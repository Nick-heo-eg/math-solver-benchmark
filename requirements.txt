# Core dependencies (Python 3.8+)
# No external dependencies for Stage-0, Stage-1A, Stage-3 (pattern matching)

# Optional: For Stage-1B and Stage-2 (LLM-based experiments)
# Note: These stages demonstrate LLM failure/caching, but are not required
# to run the main benchmark (Stage-3 pattern matching)

# LLM integration (optional, for Stage-1B/2 only)
